                    <span id="author">Peter Thiel</span>
                    <span id="description">
                        If you want to build a better future, you must believe
                        in secrets.<br /><br />The great secret of our time is
                        that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and
                        new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary
                        entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can
                        find singular ways to create those new things.
                        <br /><br />Thiel begins with the contrarian premise
                        that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even
                        if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to
                        notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but
                        there is no reason why progress should be limited to
                        computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in
                        any industry or area of business. It comes from the most
                        important skill that every leader must master: learning
                        to think for yourself.<br /><br />Doing what someone
                        else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to
                        n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do
                        something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates
                        will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page
                        or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s
                        champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in
                        today’s marketplace. They will escape competition
                        altogether, because their businesses will be unique.
                        <br /><br />Zero to One presents at once an optimistic
                        view of the future of progress in America and a new way
                        of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to
                        ask the questions that lead you to find value in
                        unexpected places.
